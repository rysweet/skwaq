### Previous Milestone: K1 - Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline

### Status: Completed âœ…

The knowledge ingestion pipeline components for Milestone K1 have been successfully implemented and all tests are passing:

- [x] Document processing pipeline
  - Implemented markdown document ingestion with semantic chunking
  - Created KnowledgeChunker for breaking documents into semantic sections
  - Added automatic extraction of vulnerability patterns from documents
  - Implemented document metadata extraction and indexing
  - Created comprehensive vector embedding for all knowledge entities

- [x] CWE database integration
  - Implemented CWEProcessor for Common Weakness Enumeration processing
  - Added support for parsing CWE XML structure
  - Created relationships between weaknesses, categories and examples
  - Implemented automatic downloading of latest CWE database
  - Added semantic summarization and vector embedding for CWEs

- [x] Core knowledge graph structure
  - Designed comprehensive knowledge graph with multiple node types
  - Implemented relationship types for connecting knowledge entities
  - Added vector search capabilities for semantic similarity
  - Created automatic relationship inference based on similarity
  - Implemented unified knowledge initialization system

Key Features:
- Semantic document chunking for improved knowledge retrieval
- Comprehensive CWE database integration with full relationship modeling
- Automatic extraction of vulnerability patterns from security documents
- Integration with CVE data and linking to CWE weaknesses
- Vector-based semantic search across all knowledge entities
- Automatic relationship discovery between related knowledge items
- Unified knowledge graph initialization system
