- [x] Code parsing and representation
  - Implemented language-specific code analysis for multiple languages
  - Created CodeAnalyzer class for vulnerability detection
  - Added support for different file formats and languages
  - Implemented language-specific pattern matching
  - Integrated with the knowledge graph for storing findings

- [x] Vulnerability pattern matching
  - Implemented pattern-based vulnerability detection
  - Created VulnerabilityPatternRegistry for managing patterns
  - Added automatic pattern generation from CWE database
  - Implemented regex-based pattern matching
  - Created comprehensive test coverage for pattern detection

- [x] Advanced code analysis techniques
  - Implemented semantic analysis using AI models
  - Added language-specific AST-like analysis for common vulnerability patterns
  - Created comprehensive detection for SQL injection, XSS, and other vulnerabilities
  - Implemented confidence scoring for findings
  - Added remediation suggestions for detected vulnerabilities

- [x] Refactoring for Improved Architecture
  - Extracted shared functionality to new `shared` module
  - Implemented Strategy pattern for analysis methods
  - Created dedicated `code_analysis` module with improved structure
  - Extracted language-specific analyzers into separate classes
  - Added PatternMatcher for improved pattern matching
  - Maintained backward compatibility for existing API users
  - Ensured all tests continue to pass

Key Features:
