# Skwaq Project Status

## Current Milestone: K1 - Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline

### Status: Not Started ðŸ”´

### Previous Milestone: F3 - Database Integration

### Status: Completed âœ…

The database integration components for Milestone F3 have been implemented and all tests are passing:

- [x] Neo4j connection module
  - Implemented Neo4jConnector with comprehensive graph operations
  - Created connection pooling and resilient retry logic
  - Added singleton access pattern for global connection
  - Implemented context manager support for safe resource handling

- [x] Schema implementation
  - Created comprehensive schema definition with NodeLabels and RelationshipTypes
  - Implemented SchemaManager for managing database schema components
  - Added constraints, indexes, and vector index creation
  - Designed clear domain model for vulnerability assessment entities

- [x] Database initialization
  - Added initialization sequence with appropriate error handling
  - Implemented schema component validation
  - Created utility for schema inspection and management
  - Added safe database clearing functionality with confirmation

- [x] Vector search integration
  - Implemented vector similarity search for semantic querying
  - Added support for embedding dimensions and similarity cutoffs
  - Created vector index management for knowledge retrieval
  - Optimized for different node types and embedding properties

Key Features:
- Comprehensive graph database operations (create, merge, query, relationships)
- Strong typing with Enum-based schema definition
- Vector search capabilities for semantic similarity
- Robust error handling and connection management
- Clear separation of concerns between connector and schema components
