# Skwaq Project Prompt History

This file maintains a running history of user prompts and a brief summary of Claude's responses and actions.

## Prompt 1 (2025-03-27)

**Prompt**: "We are working on the Ingestion Module, described in Specifications/Ingestion.md. It is mostly implemented. We are working on integration tests. Update the status after every time you return the prompt to me. 1) let's fix the neo4j deprecation warnings. 2) do the tests validate that the code summary graph entries, ast graph entries, and filesystem graph entries for a given module can all be linked together? the test may need to work with real data to make that happen. Lastly, is there a test that validates the documentation graph integration and relationship linking?"

**Response**: 
- Fixed Neo4j deprecation warnings in neo4j_connector.py by updating methods to use execute_read and execute_write
- Added new integration tests in test_ingestion_integration.py to verify relationships between different graph entry types
- Added test_graph_relationship_linking to validate linking between filesystem, AST, and summary nodes
- Added test_documentation_integration to test documentation node relationships
- Updated status.md to reflect progress

## Prompt 2 (2025-03-27)

**Prompt**: "thats excellent please commit."

**Response**:
- Created a git commit with changes to neo4j_connector.py, test_ingestion_integration.py, and status.md
- Commit message: "fix: update Neo4j connector to fix deprecation warnings and add relationship tests"

## Prompt 3 (2025-03-27)

**Prompt**: "OK, the next task is to update the CLI to use the new ingestion code. please ensure that you are using the instructions I stored in .github/copilot-instructions.md. Please look at Specifications/Ingestion.md. then look at the examples/ingestion_example.py and at skwaq/ingestion/ingestion.py. Then look at the CLI and think carefully about how to update the CLI to use the new ingestion module. don't think about how the old ingestion code references in the CLI are setup, instead remove them and insert reference to the new ingestion code. remove all references to the old code_analysis modules from the project - we have deleted them. Once you have updated the CLI code, update the CLI tests, then test the ingestions using the CLI."

**Response**:
- Updated ingest_commands.py to use the new Ingestion class
- Updated repository_commands.py to use the new Ingestion class for repository management
- Updated API repository endpoints to use the new Ingestion class
- Enhanced progress tracking and status reporting
- Added integration with OpenAI client for LLM-based summarization
- Updated status.md to reflect the CLI updates
- Made changes to properly handle both local and remote repositories
