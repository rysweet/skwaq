# Skwaq Project Prompt History

This file maintains a running history of user prompts and a brief summary of Claude's responses and actions.

## Prompt 1 (2025-03-27)

**Prompt**: "We are working on the Ingestion Module, described in Specifications/Ingestion.md. It is mostly implemented. We are working on integration tests. Update the status after every time you return the prompt to me. 1) let's fix the neo4j deprecation warnings. 2) do the tests validate that the code summary graph entries, ast graph entries, and filesystem graph entries for a given module can all be linked together? the test may need to work with real data to make that happen. Lastly, is there a test that validates the documentation graph integration and relationship linking?"

**Response**: 
- Fixed Neo4j deprecation warnings in neo4j_connector.py by updating methods to use execute_read and execute_write
- Added new integration tests in test_ingestion_integration.py to verify relationships between different graph entry types
- Added test_graph_relationship_linking to validate linking between filesystem, AST, and summary nodes
- Added test_documentation_integration to test documentation node relationships
- Updated status.md to reflect progress

## Prompt 2 (2025-03-27)

**Prompt**: "thats excellent please commit."

**Response**:
- Created a git commit with changes to neo4j_connector.py, test_ingestion_integration.py, and status.md
- Commit message: "fix: update Neo4j connector to fix deprecation warnings and add relationship tests"

## Prompt 3 (2025-03-27)

**Prompt**: "OK, the next task is to update the CLI to use the new ingestion code. please ensure that you are using the instructions I stored in .github/copilot-instructions.md. Please look at Specifications/Ingestion.md. then look at the examples/ingestion_example.py and at skwaq/ingestion/ingestion.py. Then look at the CLI and think carefully about how to update the CLI to use the new ingestion module. don't think about how the old ingestion code references in the CLI are setup, instead remove them and insert reference to the new ingestion code. remove all references to the old code_analysis modules from the project - we have deleted them. Once you have updated the CLI code, update the CLI tests, then test the ingestions using the CLI."

**Response**:
- Updated ingest_commands.py to use the new Ingestion class

## Prompt 16 (2025-03-28)

**Prompt**: "I'd like you to run a demo of the CLI, and capture it to a markdown document in docs/cli_demo.md. You should use the CLI to ingest https://github.com/dotnet/ai-samples and then run the sources and sinks workflow on that repository, and then retrieve a visualization of the graph. Include the resulting visualization in the markdown document."

**Response**:
- Created comprehensive CLI demo document showing core workflows

**Response**:
- Identified that --parse-only was limiting analysis capabilities
- Ran full ingestion without --parse-only flag for LLM summarization
- Created new investigation for the fully ingested repository
- Updated documentation to reflect proper workflow without --parse-only
- Committed updated CLI demo documentation

## Prompt 18 (2025-03-28)

**Prompt**: "Go ahead and commit as an interim. BTW you stopped updating the prompt-history again. Are you sure that the LLM summaries were being generated successfully? Can you do a cypher query to retrieve the summaries? I also think that we need to think harder about how the tool tries to identify sources and sinks, because surely the ai-samples accept user input and display user output in some places."

**Response**:
- Updated prompt-history.md with recent conversations
- Used Neo4j queries to confirm 30 CodeSummary nodes were generated
- Found summaries containing user input and SQL query references
- Identified missing repository-investigation relationship

- Identified issues with LLM analyzer and visualization

## Prompt 20 (2025-03-28)

**Prompt**: "Great, can you update everything and then remove any of the temp files you created. don't forget you are supposed to be updating the Specifications/prompt-history.md. Then revisit the cli_demo and recreate it now with the new code."

**Response**:
- Updated prompt-history.md with complete conversation history
- Removed temporary debugging files
- Recreated CLI demo documentation with the improved sources and sinks workflow
- Updated demo to show successful source and sink identification

## Prompt 21 (2025-03-28)

**Prompt**: "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below: [analysis of requirements for rebuilding the Flask API to interface with TypeScript frontend]. Please continue the conversation from where we left it off"
