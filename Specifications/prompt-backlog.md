# Prompt Backlog

These are prompts that we are writing in advance for future use. They are not currently in use.

Commit everything, update the status, and then we will move to the next step in the ImplementationPlan.md.  

Please ensure that all the new code has thorough unit tests and that all the existing tests (unit, integration, milestone) pass.

How many steps remain in the ImplementationPlan.md?

Please provide the current status of the ImplementationPlan.md and the number of steps remaining.

We are going to add a new feature to the codebase. The feature is described in the GraphicalUserInterface.md file. Ask any questions necessary to clarify the requirements and then update the file with the answers to the questions.  Then we need to update the ImplemenationPlan.md to include the new feature.  The new feature is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Vulnerability Assessment Copilot. The GUI will provide a user-friendly way to interact with the copilot, allowing users to easily start investigations, visualize graphs, view results, and manage their vulnerability assessments. Once we have the new feature in the ImplementationPlan.md, we will move on to the next step in the plan.
