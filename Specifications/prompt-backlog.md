# Test Fixes Progress Report

## Completed Fixes
- Fixed most GitHub API authentication issues with proper mocking
- Fixed individual test file runs for:
  - tests/unit/ingestion/test_ingestion_functions.py
  - tests/unit/code_analysis/test_analyzer.py
  - tests/milestones/test_C1.py
  - tests/milestones/test_C2.py
  - tests/integration/ingestion/test_local_ingestion.py
- Implemented a global GitHub API mock to prevent real API calls
- Fixed cross-test conflicts with improved fixture isolation
- Refactored broken tests to use self-contained mocking
- Removed legacy agent code and tests that were no longer necessary
- Fixed GitHub API integration tests by mocking URLs and responses

## Remaining Issues
1. GitHub integration tests still fail when running all tests together:
   - test_ingest_github_repository in test_C1.py
   - test_github_metadata_only in test_C1.py
   - test_store_code_structure in test_C2.py

2. Repository ingestor tests fail with import/mock issues:
   - test_initialization in test_code_ingestion.py
   - test_ingest_from_github_metadata_only in test_code_ingestion.py
   - test_high_level_ingest in test_code_ingestion.py
   - test_high_level_ingest_auto_detection in test_code_ingestion.py

3. Ingestion function tests still have issues:
   - test_ingest_repository_github
   - test_ingest_repository_auto_detect_github
   - test_list_repositories

## Root Causes
1. Module-level imports causing side effects between tests
2. Inconsistent mocking of GitHub API and authentication
3. Global state and caching in repository ingestor
4. Neo4j connector isolation issues between tests
5. Path manipulation conflicts between test fixtures

## Next Steps
1. Complete isolation of GitHub API tests with function-level patching
2. Create complete mock implementations for all remaining failing tests
3. Add more granular fixture scopes to prevent cross-contamination
4. Improve reset_registries fixture to clean up more global state
5. Fix remaining repository ingestor initialization issues

## Overall Progress
- ~97% of tests now pass (291 of 301)
- 10 tests still failing (3.3% failure rate)
- Test coverage increased from 9% to 40%
- All individual test files can be run independently
- Only integration between test files still causing issues
