# Specification for the Knowledge Graph Modules of the Vulnerability Asessment Copilot

# Context and Purpose



## Inputs


## Outcomes

- **Graph Representation**: A graph in the neo4j database that contains the syntax tree of the code, the filesystem layout of the code, any apidoc available for the code, and AI generated summaries of the code and the developer intent.
- **{ModuleName} Status**: A status message indicating progress and evantually whether the {ModuleName} was successful or not. This should include any errors that occurred during the {ModuleName} process.
- **{ModuleName} Time**: The time taken to ingest the codebase. This should be a timestamp indicating when the {ModuleName} started and when it finished.
- **{ModuleName} ID**: A unique identifier for the {ModuleName} process. This should be a UUID that can be used to track the {ModuleName} process in the system.
-- **{ModuleName} Metadata**: Any metadata that is available for the codebase. This should include information such as the commit history, the authors of the code, the date of the last commit, and any other relevant information that can be extracted from the codebase and will be added to the {ModuleName} graph.

## Process

1. **Input Validation**: Validate the input to ...
2.

## Dependencies

- **Neo4j**: The {ModuleName} module shall use the neo4j database to ....  The neo4j connection shall be managed by the skwaq db module. The {ModuleName} module shall use the skwaq db module to connect to the neo4j database and store the graph representation of the codebase.
- **Azure OpenAI**: The {ModuleName} module shall use the Azure OpenAI model client to ...

## Documentation

- The {ModuleName} module shall be documented in the codebase using docstrings and comments.
- The usage of the {ModuleName} module shall also be documented in the docs folder of the codebase.
- The documentation shall include examples of how to use the {ModuleName} module, including how to pass in a filesystem path or a Git URI, how to configure the LLM, and how to use the {ModuleName} ID to track the {ModuleName} process.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Code organization

consider having modules for:
 

## Testing
Outline:
- Unit testing requirements
- Integration testing approach
- Test data needs
- Edge cases to be tested
- there shall be unit tests for each of the functions in the module. Unit tests may use mocks for the neo4j database and the LLM.
- there shall be aspects of the tests to validate each of the acceptance criteria.
- there shall be integration tests for the module that test the entire process from start to finish.
  - the integration tests shall use 
  - the integration tests shall not use a mock neo4j database to test the {ModuleName} process.
  - the integration tests shall not use a mock LLM to test the {ModuleName} process.

### API Design and Interface
Consider adding details about:
- Method signatures or function interfaces
- Expected input/output data formats and structures
- Error handling and response codes
- Integration points with other components

## Example of using the {ModuleName} Module

```python

...

```

### Performance Requirements
Consider specifying:
- Expected throughput or performance targets
- Memory constraints or considerations
- Scalability requirements
- Concurrency handling

### Security Considerations
Include guidance on:
- Authentication/authorization requirements
- Data protection needs
- Input validation expectations
- Secure coding practices specific to this component

### Implementation Guidelines
Provide
