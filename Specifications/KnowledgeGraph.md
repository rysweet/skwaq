# Specification for the Knowledge Graph Modules of the Vulnerability Asessment Copilot

# Context and Purpose

The Knowledge Graph component provides a graph database and semantic index representing a collection of vulnerability discovery expertise. It also includes extracts from the repository of teh Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. The Knowledge Graph is used to store and retrieve information about vulnerabilities, their relationships, and their context, as well as best practices for searching for vulnerabilities in code. The Knowledge Graph is used for LLM retrieval augmentation for the agents that are part of the Vulnerability Assessment Copilot. Note that the Knowledge Graph is not related to the codebase and investigation graphs. 

## Inputs

The Knowledge Graph component ingests the documents and data collected in the /data/knowledge/ directory when the initialization operation is invoked. Users can also add new documents to the Knowledge Graph from the CLI, the API, or uploading them from the GUI. 

## Outcomes

- **Graph Representation**: A graph in the neo4j database that contains a concept graph of the documents that were supplied, as well as a copy of the full documents, and the semantic index of that content. The graph representation shall be stored in the neo4j database and shall be used to provide content for retrieval augmentation for LLM agents that play the role of vulnerability researchers. 

- **Knowledge Graph Status**: A status message indicating progress and evantually whether the Knowledge Graph was successful or not. This should include any errors that occurred during the Knowledge Graph process.
- **Knowledge Graph Time**: The time taken to ingest the codebase. This should be a timestamp indicating when the Knowledge Graph started and when it finished.
- **Knowledge Graph ID**: A unique identifier for the Knowledge Graph process. This should be a UUID that can be used to track the Knowledge Graph process in the system.
-- **Knowledge Graph Metadata**: Any metadata that is available for the codebase. This should include information such as the commit history, the authors of the code, the date of the last commit, and any other relevant information that can be extracted from the codebase and will be added to the Knowledge Graph graph.

## Process

1. **Input Validation**: Validate the input to ...
2.

## Dependencies

- **Neo4j**: The Knowledge Graph module shall use the neo4j database to ....  The neo4j connection shall be managed by the skwaq db module. The Knowledge Graph module shall use the skwaq db module to connect to the neo4j database and store the graph representation of the codebase.
- **Azure OpenAI**: The Knowledge Graph module shall use the Azure OpenAI model client to ...

## Documentation

- The Knowledge Graph module shall be documented in the codebase using docstrings and comments.
- The usage of the Knowledge Graph module shall also be documented in the docs folder of the codebase.
- The documentation shall include examples of how to use the Knowledge Graph module, including how to pass in a filesystem path or a Git URI, how to configure the LLM, and how to use the Knowledge Graph ID to track the Knowledge Graph process.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Code organization

consider having modules for:
 

## Testing
Outline:
- Unit testing requirements
- Integration testing approach
- Test data needs
- Edge cases to be tested
- there shall be unit tests for each of the functions in the module. Unit tests may use mocks for the neo4j database and the LLM.
- there shall be aspects of the tests to validate each of the acceptance criteria.
- there shall be integration tests for the module that test the entire process from start to finish.
  - the integration tests shall use 
  - the integration tests shall not use a mock neo4j database to test the Knowledge Graph process.
  - the integration tests shall not use a mock LLM to test the Knowledge Graph process.

### API Design and Interface
Consider adding details about:
- Method signatures or function interfaces
- Expected input/output data formats and structures
- Error handling and response codes
- Integration points with other components

## Example of using the Knowledge Graph Module

```python

### Performance Requirements
Consider specifying:
- Expected throughput or performance targets
- Memory constraints or considerations
- Scalability requirements
- Concurrency handling

### Security Considerations
Include guidance on:
- Authentication/authorization requirements
- Data protection needs
- Input validation expectations
- Secure coding practices specific to this component
