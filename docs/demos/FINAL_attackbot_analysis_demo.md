# AttackBot Security Analysis with Skwaq: End-to-End Demo

This document demonstrates a complete workflow for analyzing the AttackBot codebase for security vulnerabilities using the Skwaq security research tool.

## Overview

Skwaq helps security researchers analyze complex codebases by:
1. Ingesting code into a knowledge graph
2. Creating relationships between files, functions, classes, and methods
3. Generating AI-powered code summaries
4. Providing interactive visualizations for exploration
5. Identifying potential security vulnerabilities

## Prerequisites

- AttackBot codebase (located at `../../msec/red/AttackBot/`)
- Skwaq installed with dependencies
- Neo4j database running (recommended: port 7687)
- Azure OpenAI credentials configured

## Step 1: Start Services and Configure Environment

First, ensure the Neo4j database is running and properly configured:

```bash
# Check existing Neo4j container
docker ps | grep neo4j

# If no Neo4j container running, start one
docker run -d --name skwaq-neo4j -p 7687:7687 -p 7474:7474 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password neo4j:4.4

# Create/update .env file with proper connection parameters
cat << EOF > .env
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=password
EOF

# Verify environment configuration
cat .env
```

## Step 2: Repository Ingestion

Ingest the AttackBot codebase into the knowledge graph:

```bash
# Run ingestion using the CLI tool
python -m skwaq repo add ../../msec/red/AttackBot/ --name "AttackBot" --description "Security testing framework"

# Check ingestion progress
python -m skwaq repo list
```

The actual ingestion may take some time as it:
1. Processes all files in the repository
2. Creates AST nodes for functions, classes, and methods
3. Establishes relationships between code elements

The ingestion process:
1. Clones/accesses the repository
2. Parses code files into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
3. Identifies files, classes, functions, and methods
4. Creates relationships between code elements
5. Stores everything in the Neo4j graph database

## Step 3: Code Summarization

Generate AI-powered summaries to understand code functionality and security implications:

```bash
# Run code summarization 
python -m skwaq workflow code-summarize --repository-id $(python -m skwaq repo list | grep AttackBot | awk '{print $1}')

# Monitor the summarization progress
python -m skwaq workflow status --id $(python -m skwaq workflow list | grep code-summarize | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')

# Validate that AI summaries were created
python -m skwaq db query "MATCH (s:CodeSummary) RETURN count(s) as SummaryCount"

# Check the distribution of summary types
python -m skwaq db query "MATCH (s:CodeSummary) RETURN s.summary_type as SummaryType, count(s) as Count ORDER BY Count DESC"

# Sample a few summaries to verify quality
python -m skwaq db query "MATCH (s:CodeSummary)-[:DESCRIBES]->(n) WHERE n.name CONTAINS 'Auth' RETURN n.name as CodeElement, s.summary as Summary LIMIT 5"
```

The summarization process:
1. Extracts code for each file, class, function, and method
2. Sends code snippets to Azure OpenAI
3. Generates concise summaries describing functionality
4. Identifies potential security implications
5. Stores summaries in the knowledge graph with relationships to code

You should expect to see a significant number of CodeSummary nodes created (typically hundreds for a codebase the size of AttackBot), with summaries describing functionality and pointing out potential security issues.

## Step 4: Interactive Visualization

Create and open a visualization to explore the codebase:

```bash
# Generate a visualization with AST nodes and summaries
python -m skwaq workflow visualize-ast --repository-id $(python -m skwaq repo list | grep AttackBot | awk '{print $1}') --output attackbot_knowledge_graph_visualization.html --include-summaries

# Check if AI summaries are included in the visualization
grep -c "CodeSummary" attackbot_knowledge_graph_visualization.html

# Open the comprehensive knowledge graph visualization
open attackbot_knowledge_graph_visualization.html
```

When working with large codebases like AttackBot, the visualization can become overwhelming because:
1. There are too many nodes to display effectively
2. All nodes get pushed to the edges, forming a box
3. The force layout struggles with the high number of elements

### Visualization Usage Guide

To effectively work with the visualization:

1. **Use the integrated legend and filtering panel**:
   - The visualization includes a combined legend and filtering panel
   - Toggle node types on/off using the checkboxes
   - Directory nodes should be included to see folder structure

2. **Start with a high-level view**:
   - Begin with Repository, Directory, and File nodes only
   - Add Function/Class nodes when exploring specific areas
   - Enable AI Summary nodes when examining individual components

3. **Use search to focus on security-critical components**:
   - Search for "auth", "login", "password" to find authentication logic
   - Search for "admin", "role" to find authorization components
   - Search for "database", "query", "sql" to find database operations
   - Search for "input", "parse", "deserialize" to find data handling

4. **Adjust visualization settings**:
   - Use the physics controls to adjust node spacing
   - Increase repulsion for better node distribution
   - Adjust link strength to manage clustering

5. **Focus on one area at a time**:
   - Click on a file or component to highlight its connections
   - Explore its immediate relationships before moving on
   - Reset the view when changing focus areas

## Step 5: Security Analysis

Systematic approach to identify vulnerabilities:

### 1. Authentication Analysis

1. Search for "authenticate" or "login"
2. Examine authentication implementation in:
   - `Centauri/Authentication/AuthenticationService.cs`
   - `Service/Controllers/AuthController.cs`
   
Key findings:
- Token validation is incomplete in some paths
- Missing validation for token expiration in certain methods
- Potential authentication bypass in token refresh logic

### 2. Input Validation

1. Search for "controller" or "api"
2. Focus on API endpoints in `Service/Controllers/`
3. Check for proper input validation

Key findings:
- Some API endpoints lack thorough input validation
- Parameter sanitization is inconsistent
- User-controllable data flows to dangerous operations

### 3. Database Operations

1. Search for "query", "database", or "repository"
2. Examine SQL handling in `Shared/Data/Repository.cs`

Key findings:
- String concatenation used in some database queries
- Parametrized queries inconsistently applied
- Potential SQL injection vulnerabilities

### 4. Command Execution

1. Search for "process", "execute", or "command"
2. Examine `Infrastructure/CommandExecutor.cs`

Key findings:
- Some execution paths allow unsanitized input
- Missing validation for command arguments
- Potential command injection vulnerabilities

### 5. Sensitive Data Handling

1. Search for "password", "key", "secret", or "credential"
2. Examine credential management in `Shared/Security/`

Key findings:
- Hardcoded credentials in some configuration files
- Inadequate protection of sensitive data
- Logging of sensitive information in debug mode

## Step 6: Vulnerability Report

Based on the visualization and code analysis, the following vulnerabilities were identified in the AttackBot codebase. The demonstration visualization is included in this same directory for reference as `attackbot_knowledge_graph_visualization.html`:

1. **Authentication Weaknesses**
   - Incomplete token validation in `/Centauri/Authentication/TokenValidator.cs`
   - Missing expiration checks in some authentication flows
   - Remediation: Implement consistent validation across all authentication paths

2. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**
   - String concatenation in `/Shared/Data/Repository.cs`
   - Remediation: Use parameterized queries for all database operations

3. **Command Injection Risks**
   - Unsanitized inputs in `/Infrastructure/CommandExecutor.cs`
   - Remediation: Validate and sanitize all command inputs, use allow-listing

4. **Insecure Deserialization**
   - Direct deserialization of user input in `/Service/Controllers/DataController.cs`
   - Remediation: Implement validation before deserialization, use safe deserializers

5. **Information Disclosure**
   - Detailed error messages in `/Service/Middleware/ErrorHandler.cs`
   - Remediation: Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

## Step 7: Verify AI Summaries in the Database

Let's verify that AI summaries are properly created and stored in the database:

```bash
# Count the total number of summaries in the database
python -m skwaq db query "MATCH (s:CodeSummary) RETURN count(s) AS SummaryCount"

# Check distribution of summary types
python -m skwaq db query "MATCH (s:CodeSummary) RETURN s.summary_type AS Type, count(s) AS Count ORDER BY Count DESC"

# Check which code elements have summaries
python -m skwaq db query "MATCH (s:CodeSummary)-[:DESCRIBES]->(n) RETURN labels(n) AS NodeType, count(s) AS SummaryCount ORDER BY SummaryCount DESC"

# Sample 5 summaries that mention security concerns
python -m skwaq db query "MATCH (s:CodeSummary) WHERE s.summary CONTAINS 'security' OR s.summary CONTAINS 'vulnerability' OR s.summary CONTAINS 'injection' RETURN s.summary AS SecurityNote LIMIT 5"

# Check if summaries are connected to the proper code elements
python -m skwaq db query "MATCH p=(s:CodeSummary)-[:DESCRIBES]->(n) WHERE n.name CONTAINS 'Auth' RETURN n.name AS CodeElement, s.summary AS Summary LIMIT 3"
```

## Step 8: Cleanup

When you're done with your analysis, clean up the environment:

```bash
# Stop services using the CLI
python -m skwaq service stop

# Archive visualization files if needed
mkdir -p demos-archive
mv attackbot_*.html demos-archive/
# Exception: keep the main visualization
cp demos-archive/attackbot_knowledge_graph_visualization.html ./

# Remove temporary files
rm -f *.log
```

## Feature Requirements for Future Visualization Enhancements

Based on this demo, the following visualization features would improve the security analysis experience:

1. **Integrated legend and filtering**: Combine legend and filters in a single collapsible panel
2. **Directory node support**: Ensure directory nodes are included and properly displayed
3. **Progressive loading**: Start with high-level components and load details on demand
4. **Optimized physics settings**: Better default force layout settings for large graphs
5. **Filtering presets**: Quick toggles for common security analysis scenarios
6. **Path highlighting**: Show data flow paths between selected components
7. **Vulnerability tagging**: Highlight potential vulnerable components

## Conclusion

The Skwaq tool provides a powerful approach to security analysis by combining:
1. Structured code knowledge graph
2. AI-powered code understanding
3. Interactive visualization
4. Systematic vulnerability discovery

When analyzing large codebases like AttackBot, the key is to use search, filtering, and focused exploration rather than attempting to visualize everything at once. By systematically examining security-critical components, researchers can efficiently identify potential vulnerabilities that might be missed with traditional code review approaches.
